# GreenHouse A Social Blog App ✔
This is GreenHouse, a Blog app made by me using Java.
I used android studio as IDE for making this app,
Firebase is used as the key server and for the data storage of the user posts.

✨ Here we can post pictures in the blog

✨ Used Otp verification during Signup process

✨ Users can like and comment on the posts

✨ Profiles can be customised whenever needed

✨ Password reset can also be performed in case you forget the password

Feel free to use this application and do report me the bugs if you find one ,
accordingly I will accept fork requests ✌🏻
Incase anyone wants to test the application do clone it from this Repository 👍🏻
